# COMPAS Learning Journey üß≠

An interactive web-based learning experience that teaches the COMPAS framework through two engaging scenarios. Learn systematic problem-solving without reaching for the flamethrower - whether you're dealing with pantry moths or nonprofit AI panic!

## What is COMPAS?

COMPAS is a practical framework for approaching AI (or any technology) challenges:

- **C**ontext: Understanding your actual situation (not what you think it is)
- **O**bjective: Defining the REAL problem (not jumping to solutions)
- **M**ethod: Creating a systematic plan (that might not even need AI!)
- **P**erformance: Implementing and discovering what actually works
- **A**ssessment: Continuously checking and adjusting
- **S**uper You: Improving through repeated cycles

## Why This Game Exists

After 30 years helping nonprofits navigate technology changes, we've learned that technology is almost NEVER the problem. The problem is approaching new technology with equal parts panic, denial, and a misguided impulse to take a flamethrower to the whole thing.

This game teaches you to:
- üîç Discover "Shadow AI" use in your organization
- üéØ Avoid "solutionizing" and define real problems
- üìã Create systematic approaches that build confidence
- üí° Recognize when simple solutions beat complex AI
- üîÑ Continuously assess and adjust your approach
- ‚≠ê Compound small improvements into transformation

## The Pantry Moth Principle ü¶ã

Just like dealing with a pantry moth infestation, implementing AI requires:
- Understanding the full extent of the problem (not panicking)
- Avoiding flamethrower solutions that cause more damage
- Using systematic approaches (bay leaves > flamethrowers)
- Checking and adjusting your approach regularly
- Getting slightly better with each attempt

## Two Scenarios, Same Wisdom

### ü¶ã The Great Moth Infestation
Learn COMPAS through a hilarious personal crisis involving pantry moths, vacuum cleaners, and the dangerous temptation of flamethrowers. Perfect for understanding the framework through a lighthearted, relatable crisis.

### üíº The Nonprofit AI Panic  
Apply COMPAS to help Monica's arts nonprofit navigate board pressure to "implement AI" when the real problem is spreadsheet chaos. Ideal for organizational leaders facing technology pressure.

Both scenarios teach identical COMPAS principles but through different lenses - showing how the framework applies to any challenge, from kitchen crises to boardroom pressure.

## Features

- **Choose Your Adventure**: Two complete scenarios teaching the same framework
- **Immediate Feedback**: Learn why certain approaches work (or don't)
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress through the COMPAS framework
- **Mobile Responsive**: Learn on any device
- **No Installation Required**: Just open in a web browser
- **Scenario Reset**: Try both paths to see COMPAS applied differently

## Remember

> "Technology is almost NEVER the problem. The problem is that we often approach the challenges of new technology the way I initially approached my pantry moth infestation‚Äîequal parts panic, denial, and a misguided but powerful impulse to take a flamethrower to the whole thing."

Don't be a flamethrower person. Be a COMPAS navigator. üß≠
