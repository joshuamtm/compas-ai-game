# COMPAS AI Learning Journey üß≠

An interactive web-based learning experience that helps nonprofit leaders navigate AI adoption without burning down their organizations. Based on the COMPAS framework, this game uses humor, relatable scenarios, and a memorable pantry moth analogy to teach systematic AI implementation.

## What is COMPAS?

COMPAS is a practical framework for approaching AI (or any technology) challenges:

- **C**ontext: Understanding your actual situation (not what you think it is)
- **O**bjective: Defining the REAL problem (not jumping to solutions)
- **M**ethod: Creating a systematic plan (that might not even need AI!)
- **P**erformance: Implementing and discovering what actually works
- **A**ssessment: Continuously checking and adjusting
- **S**uper You: Improving through repeated cycles

## Why This Game Exists

After 30 years helping nonprofits navigate technology changes, we've learned that technology is almost NEVER the problem. The problem is approaching new technology with equal parts panic, denial, and a misguided impulse to take a flamethrower to the whole thing.

This game teaches you to:
- üîç Discover "Shadow AI" use in your organization
- üéØ Avoid "solutionizing" and define real problems
- üìã Create systematic approaches that build confidence
- üí° Recognize when simple solutions beat complex AI
- üîÑ Continuously assess and adjust your approach
- ‚≠ê Compound small improvements into transformation

## The Pantry Moth Principle ü¶ã

Just like dealing with a pantry moth infestation, implementing AI requires:
- Understanding the full extent of the problem (not panicking)
- Avoiding flamethrower solutions that cause more damage
- Using systematic approaches (bay leaves > flamethrowers)
- Checking and adjusting your approach regularly
- Getting slightly better with each attempt
